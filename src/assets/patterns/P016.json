  "aka": "",
  "motivation": "ML systems are complex because their\nML components must be (re)trained regularly and have an intrinsic non-deterministic behavior. Similar to other systems,\nthe business requirements for these systems as well as ML algorithms change over time.",
  "solution": "Define clear APIs between traditional and\nML components. Place business and ML components with different responsibilities into three layers (Fig. 2). Divide data flows into three.",
  "consequences": "Decoupling “traditional” business and ML components allows the ML components to be monitored and adjusted to meet users’ requirements and changing inputs.",
