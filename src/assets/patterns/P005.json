  "motivation": "",
  "solution": "Each layer consisting of sub-modules\ncan be independently designed to feed into foreign prototypes. Each layer has an input and corresponding output to the succeeding layer. The succeeding return is used as a feed to\nthe next layers for further processing. Every layer communicates only with its direct neighbor",
  "consequences": "enables inference of results at the individual steps.\nExtra components can be added or modified to meet the computational requirements giving it high flexibility",
